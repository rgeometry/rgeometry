--------------------------------

## What is RGeometry?

RGeometry is a collection of data types such as points, polygons, lines, and segments, and a variety of algorithms for manipulating them. This crate will be of use to you if you've ever wondered if a point is inside a polygon or if a bank is adequately covered by surveillance cameras.

Check out the API documentation for more details. Under each function, there is an interactive example (powered by rust->wasm).

## MSRV

rust-1.59

If you want to learn Rust or computational geometry or both, hit me up in discord and I'll (@lemmih) mentor you. There is a long list of algorithms (ranging from easy to difficult) yet to be implemented in Rust.
